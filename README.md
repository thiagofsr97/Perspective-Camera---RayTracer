# Perspective Camera Implementation

The project is about the implementation of the perspective camera (pinhole), complementing the 
Ray Tracer project forked at https://github.com/capagot/RT-Template

# Algorithm Used 

The implementation of the perspective camera was made based on the content presented on the website https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/ray-tracing-generating-camera-rays/generating-camera-rays.

The resulting .cpp code of the camera implementation is the given below(the source files are present in the repository):

```cpp

#include "perspective_camera.h"

const float PerspectiveCamera::kDegreesToRadians_ = static_cast< float >( M_PI ) / 180.0f;

PerspectiveCamera::PerspectiveCamera( void )
{ }

PerspectiveCamera::PerspectiveCamera( 
                                      const glm::ivec2 &resolution,
                                      const glm::vec3 &position,
                                      const glm::vec3 &up_vector,
                                      const glm::vec3 &look_at,
                                      const float min_x,
                                      const float max_x,
                                      const float min_y,
                                      const float max_y,
                                      float aspect,
                                      float fov_degrees ) :
        Camera::Camera{ resolution,
                        position,
                        up_vector,
                        look_at },
        min_x_{ min_x },
        max_x_{ max_x },
        min_y_{ min_y },
        max_y_{ max_y },
        aspect_{ aspect },
        fov_degrees_{ fov_degrees }
{ }

Ray PerspectiveCamera::getWorldSpaceRay( const glm::vec2 &pixel_coord ) const
{
    float witdh  = max_x_ - min_x_;
    float height = max_y_ - min_y_;

    float x_value = ((witdh * pixel_coord[0]/static_cast< float >(resolution_[0])) - (witdh/2) ) * aspect_ * tan(fov_degrees_ * 0.5f * PerspectiveCamera::kDegreesToRadians_);
    float y_value = ((height/2) -  (height*(pixel_coord[1]/static_cast< float >(resolution_[1])))) * tan(fov_degrees_ * 0.5f * PerspectiveCamera::kDegreesToRadians_);
    
    glm::vec3 ray_local_dir{ x_value , y_value , -1.0f};

    return Ray{ position_, glm::normalize( onb_.getBasisMatrix() * ray_local_dir ) };
}

# Importer - Assimp

The imported used in the project to load the models was the so called Assimp. The code files used to load all the modes is also present in the repository.
# Model Samples 

Below are some of model samples that were loaded and rendered using the Ray Tracer with Perspective Camera.

**All the models are in the format .blend (Blender), using triangular faces and standard coordinate system.**

## Model 1 - Monkeys Tree

- Time to load and render model: 52.6757 seconds.
- Number of primitives used: 10637.
- Image description: 11 monkey heads of the same size located in different positions so as to form a design similar to a tree, presenting in its constitution random colors.

## Model 2 - The four monkeys

- Time to load and render model: 25.7383 seconds.
- Number of primitives used: 3868.
- Image description: 4 monkey heads of the same size located in different positions, presenting in their constitution random colors, demonstrating well the concept of camera perspective.

## Model 3 - The 10 Colored Men

- Time to load and render model: 105.276 seconds.
- Number of primitives used: 19680.
- Image description: set of several models of a human being positioned in several different positions, all being the same size.
